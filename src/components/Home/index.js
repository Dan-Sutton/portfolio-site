        <p>
          Hi! My name is Dewa, and I'm a Software developer. I worked previously
          as a Sound Engineer in the TV industry, and have always been
          fascinated and passionate about tech. I took a journey into the tech
          world after discovering the wonderful world of code. I tought myself
          the fundamentals of Fullstack Web Development, and then decided to
          apply for the School of Code Bootcamp.
